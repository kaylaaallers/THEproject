The Big Picture 
<p> 
For my project I have decided to create a video game. The video game will resemble a type of Sonic or Steve the Dino game in which the main character will have to avoid obstacles. This game will be for all ages and will take the player on an adventure. If the coding and game goes well, I hope to later incorporate a boss level. In terms of timing there will only be one level and within that level you will have to complete different objectives. This video game will be both enjoyable and fun. 

First Round 
For Round 1, using turtle I will make a program where i can move the turtle using the arrow keys.Then I am going to set one obstacle and if the turtle crashes into the obstacle, I'm going to print the word crash. In the first few weeks, I hope to accomplish this task and then later on I hope to include obstacles.

Test Plan for Round One 
The user uses the arrow keys to move the turtle and if the turtle crashes into an object then the word, "crash" will appear.

Reflections and Revisions 
So far I was only able to get the arrow keys working but ran out of time and was unable to get started on the obstacles. For this reason, I'm going to save the obstacles until Round 2.

Next Steps
The next steps are to include obstacles. However instead of just one single obstacle, there will be multiple and the gamer will have to manuver the turtle around the obstacles safely. This can serve as a "boss level" for the game.
