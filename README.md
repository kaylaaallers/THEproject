The Big Picture 
<p> 
For my project I have decided to create a video game. The video game will resemble a type of Sonic or Steve the Dino game in which the main character will have to avoid obstacles. This game will be for all ages and will take the player on an adventure. If the coding and game goes well, I hope to later incorporate a boss level. In terms of timing there will only be one level and within that level you will have to complete different objectives. This video game will be both enjoyable and fun. 

First Round 
<p>
For Round 1, using turtle I will make a program where i can move the turtle using the arrow keys.Then I am going to set one obstacle and if the turtle crashes into the obstacle, I'm going to print the word crash. In the first few weeks, I hope to accomplish this task and then later on I hope to include obstacles.

Test Plan for Round One 
<p>
The user uses the arrow keys to move the turtle and if the turtle crashes into an object then the word, "crash" will appear.

Reflections and Revisions 
<p>
So far I was only able to get the arrow keys working but ran out of time and was unable to get started on the obstacles. For this reason, I'm going to save the obstacles until Round 2.

Next Steps
<p>
The next steps are to include obstacles. However instead of just one single obstacle, there will be multiple and the gamer will have to manuver the turtle around the obstacles safely. This can serve as a "boss level" for the game. 

The Big Change
<p>
After a couple months, I felt like my project had a hit a dead end. After creating the race car game during a computer science class, my project no longer felt original. My once great idea for a project now seemed pointless. So I decided it was time for a change. One day after school, I was at home thinking about what to do for a project while on a call to my dad, then I heard my sister say "I beat Dad in Connect 4" and suddenly I knew what to do. I ended up on deciding to do code a Connect Four Game.

The Big Picture
<p>
  The idea of Connect Four is quite simple. The objective is literally to, connect four counters in a row. There are two different colors, one player is red and the other player is yellow. Both players must stop each other from trying to obtain four in a row. Similar to my othe project, this game is for all ages. If it goes well, maybe I could do some research on the game and look into the statistics and find out the best way to win.
  
  First Round
  <p>
  The user will be shown a grid where there will be numbers 0-6 showing horizontally. Then the user will select a number and whether   they are red or yellow, a letter R or Y will be shown in the place that they've decided to move to. Then it changes to player 2 and the same rules will follow. 
  
  Test Plan for Round One
  <p>
  Since my project is already complete, for my test plan of Round 2 of this project, I would like to look into the statistics of the game and maybe create tips on the bottom so I could help the players win.
  
  Reflections and Revisions
  <p>
  I am quite happy about how far my project has come and hopefully in college I will be able to touch it up.
  
  Next Steps
  <p>
  The next steps are to include tips on the bottom of the page to help users.
